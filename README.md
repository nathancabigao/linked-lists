# linked-lists
A Ruby Linked List Implementation.

This project was done for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-linked-lists).

## Instructions
To test the results of my implementation, clone the repo and run `ruby ./main.rb`

## Afterword
This project was a great way to refresh my memory on Linked Lists, and showcases the simplicity of Ruby. I found implementation of Linked Lists to be quite simple overall, with the exception of `#remove_at` and `#insert_at`, which both took a good understanding of how to reassign `.next_node`s. And so, I found great value in doing the "Extra Credit" section of the assignment. Overall, I am excited to dive deeper into Data Structures in Ruby.
